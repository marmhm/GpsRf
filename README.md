# GpsRf

GpsRf is a method for predicting Drug-Drug interaction.
I represented this method in my master thesis.

Drug-Drug interaction defenition:

A change in a drugâ€™s effect on the body when the drug is taken together with a second drug. A drug-drug interaction can delay, decrease, or enhance absorption of either drug. This can decrease or increase the action of either or both drugs or cause adverse effects.
